# IR-calculation-from-MD-trajectory
This project contains codes I currently use to calculate IR spectrum from MD simulations.
I and my coworkers developed the first frequency maps and coupling models within the nucleobase carbonyl stretch region. These models form a complete framework enabling one to predict the vibrational Hamiltonian from coordinate files generated from MD simulations.

To understand the theoretical background, please refer to the following papers:

In this project, I include all the codes needed to calculate IR spectrum from MD simulations. This code can be applied to systems containing multiple identical oligonucleotide strands with primary bases (AGCTU). Here I use an RNA oligomer as an example. Changes are needed if one wants to consider DNA oligomers because of the atom number difference between ribose and deoxyribose. Specifically, "natom" array in 1_EF_traj.f90 should be "33,30,32,32" (change U to T and minus 1 atom for each nucleotide) and matrix of UR should be changed to "DT=reshape([25,21,14,26,22,16,23,23,15],shape(DT))". "ab" parameter in 2_Coup_traj_TCC.f90 and 2_TD_traj.f90 should minus one (6 for DNA). The source codes (.f90) as well as the compiled files (.out) are both included. Besides, some necessary parameter files are included too.

Example input and output files (.dat) of this RNA oligomer are provided. The direct input coordinate file should be an xyz file. I also provide the corresponding pdb file so that one can know more detailed information concerning each atom. The charge file (1_Charge.dat) contains partial charges in AMBER internal unit and they are converted to electron charges accordingly in the electric field calculation (1_EF_traj.f90). The box parmeters (1_box.dat) are in Angstrom. These example files only contain 10 snaptshots. To acquire a reasonable final IR spectrum, much more snapshots are needed. For example, as indicated in these codes, I need 200,000 snapshots with a time step of 10 fs to get an IR spectrum. Finally, I provide an example script file to execute those calculation steps (3_script_IR).
